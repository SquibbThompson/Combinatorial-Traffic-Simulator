# Combinatorial-Traffic-Simulator

Usage

    Input: The user provides a numerical input (0-255), which is converted into binary representation.

    Simulation: The program generates binary, reflected, and XNOR tables to simulate different traffic scenarios.

    Analysis: The movement of traffic is analyzed, providing insights into potential gridlocks and flow patterns.

    Output: All tables and analyses are saved to a text file, traffic_simulation_tables.txt, for further study.

Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash

git clone [repository-link]
